# PLEASE SEE FINAL.cpp for full code
final.cpp contains code that fully integrates all aspects of previous labs. The code enables the rover to detect a flag, capture it and drop it back off from the starting point. 

Housing all code written by me and Brandon Rutherford during our time in the ELEC 299 course at Queen's University. Note some code was written by the instructional team, all code will be cited appropriately.

Code was designed to work Lynxmotion rovers provided by the ELEC 299 course staff.
